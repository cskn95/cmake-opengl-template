#### NOT: CMake setup created and tested in GNU/Linux. Windows support added via AI. Additional settings may be required.

## Basic, easy-to-read yet powerfull CMake
- Header files added to `include` and `src` folders are automatically added to CMake; do not add them manually or via IDE.
- Latest C++ standards applied across the project.
- GLFW3 added via system packages, please use your package manager to download and install.
- Glad added as documented and supports OpenGL 4.6.

## One of the most advanced templates
- Including a separate custom input manager and OpenGL error reporting taken from Low Level Game Dev.
- The main code has been split into sub-classes and structs for easier development and modularity.
- Following C++ 23 and RAII standards!
